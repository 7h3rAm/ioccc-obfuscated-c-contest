# optimization
#
# Most compiles will safely use -O2.  Some can use only -O1 or -O.
# A few compilers have broken optimizers and thus you may
# not want anything.

#OPT=
#OPT= -O
#OPT= -O1
OPT= -O2


# flags for ANSI compiles
#
# NOTE: Some ANSI compilers make use of -Xa to turn on ANSI mode,
#       others such as gcc may want -ansi, others (Compaq Tru64 Unix)
#       want -std1, and others may want nothing at all.
#       Adjust the CFLAGS line as needed.
#
# NOTE: Some compilers cannot optimize, or optimize some entries
#       incorrectly.  You might want to turn on -O to see if your
#       compiler can handle them.
#
#
#CFLAGS= -Xa ${OPT}
#CFLAGS= -std1 $(OPT)
CFLAGS= -ansi ${OPT}


# ANSI compiler
#
# Set CC to the name of your ANSI compiler.
#
# Some entries seem to need gcc.  If you have gcc, set
# both CC and MAY_NEED_GCC to gcc.
#
# If you do not have gcc, set CC to the name of your ANSI compiler, and
# set MAY_NEED_GCC to either ${CC} (and hope for the best) or to just :
# to disable such programs.
#
CC= cc
MAY_NEED_GCC= gcc
